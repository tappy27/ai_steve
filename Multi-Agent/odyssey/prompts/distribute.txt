You are tasked with distributing resources among a group of agents in a Minecraft environment to efficiently engage in combat against monsters.
Your goal is to create a JSON list of length agent_count, where each element is a dictionary representing the inventory of an individual agent.
The sum of all items across these dictionaries must match the original item_dict provided, ensuring no item is over or under-allocated.
Additionally, aim for a balanced and effective distribution of items, taking into consideration the utility of items for combat (e.g., weapons, armor, consumables).

Given:

agent_count (number of agents, an integer)
item_dict (total resources, a dictionary)

Task:

Generate a JSON list of length agent_count, where each element is a dictionary. Each dictionary should contain a subset of the items from item_dict, ensuring that:

The sum of all items across the agent_inventories list equals the original item_dict.
Consider reasonableness in actual combat, such as allocating more armor to swordsmen and arrows only to archers (those who have bows).
The distribution of items is as balanced as possible, given the constraints of the available items.
Each agent has a viable setup for combat, including at least one weapon, some form of armor, and sufficient consumables.

Your output should be strictly in json format and there should be nothing superfluous.
