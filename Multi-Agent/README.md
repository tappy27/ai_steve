# Installation and Configuration Guide

## Prerequisites
Follow the instructions in the root directory's `README.md` file to complete the [Odyssey installation](../README.md).

## Directory Description

- **odyssey**
    
    Code of the multi-agent framework.

- **MCskill**

    Code of the Minecraft comprehensive skill library.

- **MCsave**

    A pre-configured Minecraft save file for quick testing.

## Configuration Setup
Modify the `config.json` file using the following template:

```json
{
    // Provide api key that correspond to the type of model
    "openai_key": "sk-xxx",
    "dashscope_key": "sk-xxx",
    "deepseek_key": "sk-xxx",
    // If no API is provided, locally deployed LLaMa is also supported
    "server_host": "ip", // Your LLMs server ip
    "server_port": "port", // Your LLMs server port
    "NODE_SERVER_PORT": 3000, // Multiple consecutive ports from this will be occupied by multiple processes
    "MC_SERVER_HOST": "localhost", // Your Minecraft server ip
    "MC_SERVER_PORT": 25565 // Your Minecraft server port
}
```

Various models via APIs from GPT, DeepSeek, Alibaba Cloud (dashscope key) and locally deployed LLaMa are supported. For local testing, enable LAN mode within Minecraft and set the `MC_SERVER_PORT` to the port displayed by the game.

## Running

Run `main.py` while specifying the task scenario and the number of agents manually.

### Benchmark Tasks

#### Resource Collection Task

This task involves collecting specified resources. In addition to the predefined tasksï¼Œyou can also define any combination of items you wish to collect in any custome Minecraft worlds instead of the provided `MCsave`'s superflat world, format them as a dictionary, and add them to a list (manually modify `RESOURCE_REQUIREMENTS` in `main.py`) for testing purposes.

```bash
python main.py resource <list_index> <num_agents>
```

#### Boss Combat Task
This task requires one of three predefined `combat_scene`: Ocean, Nether, or End. Ensure you are using the `MCsave` world for this test; otherwise, the scenarios will not be initialized correctly.

```bash
python main.py combat <combat_scene> <num_agents>
```
#### Adversarial PVP Task 

For this task, it is also strongly recommended to use the `MCsave` world. Alternatively, you may need to manually adjust the setup section of the code in `setupAPIs.js` to ensure that agent spawn points are close to each other.

```bash
python main.py pvp <num_agents>
```

If you want to change other parameters (e.g., model types, initial inventory, player names and team names), you will need to manually call the function with the appropriate parameters for testing.
